# TicTacToe
4x4 TicTacToe game written in C#


This was a project that I've written for my programming class at university.
It has 2-player mode that 2 players make their moves in a row.
I also tried to add a 1-player mode that player plays with the computer. It works but algorithm needs to be improvised.
